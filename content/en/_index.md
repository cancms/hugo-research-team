        Random matrix optics introduces the random matrix toolbox to the representation of light wave-particle duality. Starting in 2019, our group focused on light field representation, decomposition, detection, and manipulation using the random matrix representation. Random matrix representation provides a statistical gating strategy for different components in the light field. For example, the single and multiple scattering component in wide-field reflective imaging; the ballistic and multiple scattering component in spectral-domain OCT. The gated multiple scattering component facilitates the calculation of absorption information for in-vivo tissue imaging.
